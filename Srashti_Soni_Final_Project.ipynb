        "In this project, I will be implementing an airport management system using OOP principles such as inheritance and polymorphism. Also, I will be using optimized searching and sorting algorithms to search the flight or to list the number of flights and passengers etc. Below are the classes which will be used to develop a management system.\n",
        "\n",
        "Classes:\n",
        "  1. Person: This is a base class which contains general information about a person.\n",
        "  2. Passenger: This is a child class of a Person which will represent a passenger. It will contain information about a specific passenger such as their name, age, gender, and flight information.\n",
        "  3. Employee: This is a child class of base class person.\n",
        "  4. Airport: This is a parent class which will represent the airport. This class contains general information about the airport such as its name, number of runways, locations, and number of gates.\n",
        "  5. Flight: This is a child class which will represent a flight. This class will contain information about the specific flight such as its flight number, departure time, arrival time, origin, and destination etc.\n",
        "  \n",
        "We will be implementing two methods:\n",
        "  1. Search flight by number: This method will help us to search for a flight in the airport's list of flights by its flight number and will return the flight object if found.\n",
        "  2. Sort flights by departure time: This method will sort the airport's list of flight by departure time using the merge sort algorithm.\n",
        "  \n",
        "Optimized Searching and Sorting Algorithms:\n",
        "1. Binary Search: This algorithm is used to search for a specific flight by its flight number. Since the list of flights will already be sorted by flight number, binary search will provide an efficient way to search for a specific flight in O (log n) time complexity.\n",
        "2. Merge Sort: The time complexity of merge sort is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because the algorithm divides the list into halves recursively, sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves."
